##About

A hackernews ncurses CLI reader written in Go

Right now it's able to view articles, view comments, and open a page in your default browser, all done directly from the site using goquery (jquery-like library for Go), goncurses, and xdg-open for opening pages.

It's really not much, but I like it because I can view and interact with things a bit faster in the terminal.

It's also got a clunky REST API that can be started via the -s option. I'd intended to do some caching so I could expose an API publicly, but shortly after that, HN came out with their own API. I don't really plan to do much with the API in the future.

##API (unfinished/unnecessary)

This basically only works for page 1 in its current state, IIRC.

```bash
$ hn -s -p 3000 & 

$ curl localhost:3000
```
